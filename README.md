# Split-the-bill site

**About**

A one-page site which allows users to split a bill to determine how much each individual needs to contribute to the bill (assuming equal contributions).


**Purpose**

The site is built with a combination of html, css, and javascript with extensive use of the Bootstrap framework for styling.

I built this to reinforce the following key concepts:

- Bootstrap fundamentals
- Use of localStorage to enable persistence of data (for individual categories)
- Disabling / Enabling checkboxes via events
- Adding validation to event listeners (only display calculation component if bill per person is greater than 0)
